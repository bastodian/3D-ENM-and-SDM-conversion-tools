Here I provide two scripts that allow conversion of ASCII grid files
for 3D Ecological Niche and Species Distribution Modeling:

1) combine.sh
2) separate.sh

Refer to the comments of the scripts for information on their use. Both
scripts are written in Bash and should work on Linux, MacOS, and Cygwin.

A zip archive can be downloaded from:
https://github.com/bastodian/3D-ENM-and-SDM-conversion-tools/zipball/master

After unzipping the archive, make the files executable using chmod. 
Eg, navigate to the directory where you put the scripts. 

$ chmod u+x *sh

Scripts can then be executed from within the directory:

$ ./separate.sh /path/to/input/file.asc /path/to/output 12
$ ./combine.sh /path/to/ASCII/files outputfile.asc

The ASCII_Grids folder contains three ASCII grid files that were used for
3D ENM/SDM. These grids were derived from the variables of the WORLD OCEAN
ATLAS 2005.
