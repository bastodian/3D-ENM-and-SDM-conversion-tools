Here I provide two scripts that allow conversion of ASCII grid files
for 3D Ecological Niche and Species Distribution Modeling:

1) combine.sh
2) separate.sh

Refer to the comments of the scripts for information on their use. Both
scripts are written in Bash and should work on Linux, MacOS, and Cygwin.

The ASCII_Grids folder contains three ASCII grid files that were used for
3D ENM/SDM. These grids were derived from the variables of the WORLD OCEAN
ATLAS 2005.
